## So far all that I have really learned is a lot actually. Prior to this course I have never used Git or Github.
### Learning the uses and all of the terms such as forks, branches, cloning, pushing have been the toughest in tandem with a new platform but im sure these will become more natural in time with practical use. 
### Overall I am super excited to learn this platform, its almost 99% of the time that its tough at first but always great when it clicks to add a new tool to the belt.
